This note documents how to measure transistor characteristic curves using an oscilloscope as described in [@debuyl2010]. The circuit is also based on Lab 33 in [@buchla2010].

The collector current, $I_C$, of a bipolar junction transistor varies with the collector-emitter voltage, $V_{CE}$, as well as the transistor's base current, $I_B$. A collector-emitter characteristic curve is a plot of $I_C$ against $V_{CE}$ for a specified value of $I_B$. By setting various values of $I_B$, we can measure and plot a family of characteristic curves.

We can measure transistor characteristics using the following circuit

```{=tex}
\begin{center}
\begin{circuitikz}[american]
\draw (0,1) [battery, v=$V_1$] to (0,0) node[ground]{};
\draw (0,1) |- (0,2) to [R, l^=$R_B$, a_=\SI{33}{k\ohm}] (2,2);
\draw (3,2) node[npn](npn1) {2N3904}
  (npn1.base) node[anchor=east] {}
  (npn1.collector) node[anchor=south] {}
  (npn1.emitter) node[anchor=north] {}
;
\draw (npn1.base) to (2,2);
\draw (npn1.emitter) to (3,0) node[ground]{};
\draw (npn1.collector) to [R, l=$R_C$, a=\SI{100}{\ohm}] (3,6) |- (6,6) to [sV=$V_2$] (6,3) to (6,2) node[ground]{};
\draw[red, ->] (4.5, 5.5) node {CH1} (4, 5.5) to (3.1, 5.5);
\draw[red, ->] (4.5, 3)   node {CH2} (4, 3)   to (3.1, 3);
\end{circuitikz}
\end{center}
```
$V_1$ is a DC voltage source that can be set to various voltages to determine various levels of base current, $I_B$. Because the transistor's internal emitter resistance, $r_e$, is small relative to $R_B$, in this circuit

$$
I_B \approx \frac{V_1}{R_B} = \frac{V_1}{33 k\Omega}
$$

The characteristic curve is $I_C$ as a function of $V_{CE}$. In this circuit

$$
I_C = \frac{V_2 - V_{CE}}{R_C}
$$

We connect the oscilloscope channel 1 at the top of $R_C$, and channel 2 at the collector, as indicated in the circuit diagram above. This lets us measure

$$
V_2 = V_{CH1}
$$

and

$$
V_{CE} = V_{CH2}
$$

So

$$
I_C = \frac{V_{CH1} - V_{CH2}}{R_C} = \frac{V_{CH1} - V_{CH2}}{100 \Omega}
$$
which we will plot against $V_{CE}$.

For a given voltage, $V_1$, we can trace out a characteristic curve by setting $V_2$ to a sawtooth waveform with a frequency of 100 Hz and voltage of 0V to 10V. Each cycle of the sawtooth waveform $V_2$ traces out a characteristic curve.

We set the DC voltage source $V_1$ to each the following voltages:

> $0.5V$, $1.0V$, $1.5V$, $2.0V$, $2.5V$, $3.0V$, $3.5V$, $4.0V$, $4.5V$, $5.0V$

and capture the output of the oscilloscope as a CSV file for each voltage.

Here is a representative set of waveforms from the oscilloscope for $V_1$ = $2.5V$.

We then use the R language to read and combine the oscilloscope data.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

\AddToHookNext{env/Highlighting/begin}{\small}
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
V1_05 <- read_csv("2N3904/RigolDS0.csv", col_types = "dd??")
V1_05$V1 <- 0.5

V1_10 <- read_csv("2N3904/RigolDS1.csv", col_types = "dd??")
V1_10$V1 <- 1.0

V1_15 <- read_csv("2N3904/RigolDS2.csv", col_types = "dd??")
V1_15$V1 <- 1.5

V1_20 <- read_csv("2N3904/RigolDS3.csv", col_types = "dd??")
V1_20$V1 <- 2.0

V1_25 <- read_csv("2N3904/RigolDS4.csv", col_types = "dd??")
V1_25$V1 <- 2.5

V1_30 <- read_csv("2N3904/RigolDS5.csv", col_types = "dd??")
V1_30$V1 <- 3.0

V1_35 <- read_csv("2N3904/RigolDS6.csv", col_types = "dd??")
V1_35$V1 <- 3.5

V1_40 <- read_csv("2N3904/RigolDS7.csv", col_types = "dd??")
V1_40$V1 <- 4.0

V1_45 <- read_csv("2N3904/RigolDS8.csv", col_types = "dd??")
V1_45$V1 <- 4.5

V1_50 <- read_csv("2N3904/RigolDS9.csv", col_types = "dd??")
V1_50$V1 <- 5.0

t_df <- rbind(V1_05, V1_10, V1_15, V1_20, V1_25,
              V1_30, V1_35, V1_40, V1_45, V1_50)
```

{{< pagebreak >}}
Finally, we compute $I_B$, $I_C$, and $V_{CE}$, and plot the characteristic curves.

```{r echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
t_df |>
  mutate(IB = as.factor(round((V1 / 33000)*1e6)),
         IC = ((CH1V - CH2V)/100)*1000, VCE = CH2V) |>
  ggplot(aes(VCE, IC, color = fct_reorder2(IB, VCE, IC))) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Transistor characteristic curves",
       subtitle = "2N3904",
       x = expression(paste(V[CE], " (V)")),
       y = expression(paste(I[C], " (mA)")),
       color = expression(paste(I[B], " (Î¼A)"))) +
  theme_minimal()
```
